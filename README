Required Java Version: 11
Tests run via Maven

To run the dealership scraper tests, ensure you have Java 11+ and Maven 3+ installed and from the command line in
the project directory write:
`mvn clean test`

To run the dealership scraper program, ensure you have Java installed and from the command line write:
`java -jar dealership-scraper-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <positive-criteria>`

This will scrape the first 5 pages of reviews for 'McKaig Chevrolet Buick - A Dealer For The People' on DealerRater.com

The 3 most positive reviews will be printed out to the terminal
according to the positive criteria posted in the command when running.

The first thing to compare is review score, according to the stars out of 5 that are present in the overall
rating on the left side of the review. If the ratings are the same we move onto an alternative method of comparison
to better determine which reviews are more suspiciously positive

The positive-criteria option can be one of several values, username will print out the reviews in
reverse-alphabetical order (usernames that start with z will come before usernames that start with y etc.)
datePosted will sort based on the date the review was posted (more recent will come before older reviews)
reviewLength will sort based on the overall length of the review as longer reviews tend to be more positive and suspicious

The positive-criteria input is optional and if not supplied or if multiple/invalid arguments are
passed into the program, it will run in reviewLength mode by default.

TODO:
The program is wired with springboot, but in the interest of time many of its functionalities were not implemented.
Future iterations of this project can be set up to put the URLs of dealers in application.properties for
dynamic variable use.  The other feature that was not able to be finished in time is Natural Language Processing
via wit.ai and its library.  This could be used to compare overall positive sentiments through word usage for an even
more accurate look into which reviews are most positive.  Training the NLP to search for positive words and score them
appropriately was too time consuming, so other methods of positive determination were prioritized.
